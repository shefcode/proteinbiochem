# Structural Bioinformatics VP4 Protease :microbe:
Currently employing two approaches to determine structural properties of viral protease:
1. Using `R` package `Bio3D`
    - Code:
      - `Bio3D_VP4.ipynb` - Troubleshooting error for `muscle` :construction_worker_woman:
2. Using `python` package `BioPython` and `pyRosetta`
    - Sample data from Drosophila X Virus for `Investigating Gene and Protein Properties.ipynb`
      - Drosophila X Virus Segment A sequence - `drosophila_x_virus_segment_A_complete_sequence.fasta`  	:dna:
      - Amino acid sequence for Drosophila X Virus Polyprotein `polyprotein_Drosophila_X_virus_sequence.fasta` 	:dna:
    - Code:
      - `Investigating Gene and Protein Properties.ipynb` - Contains all functional code :white_check_mark:
      - `sample_code_pyRosetta.ipynb` - Troubleshooting error through `Google Collab` :construction_worker_woman:
